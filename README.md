# PicoVoiceImplementations
A repository containing some of the problems from PicoVoice's challenge. 

Each solution is present in the respective folders. Folder names: 

1. CIFG - A Deep Learning Model that has small tweaks to a vanilla LSTM.
2. CStack - A Generic Stack that can work with all data types, hacked using a `void*`.
3. patternMatcher - A super easy Pattern Matcher based on Dynamic Programming. 

Instructions are given inside each folder. Contact me at arka161@gmail.com in case of any doubts :)
